        <h2>Why am I learning Web Development?</h2>
        <p>I was working in a large company and there I realise that my current job wasn't 
            the thing a want the rest of my life so I looked for an alternative. My best friend
            told me that there are possiblities to learn new stuff in the IT and so a stumbled 
            to Neue Fische and the rest is history.
